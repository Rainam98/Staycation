# Staycation
CS 6314 WPL Project

We will use following documentation of Bootstrap for reference
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/


I have added protection for code push. So create pull request once you want to add your code to repo

I have created the branch for each one of us 

make the chages in that branch and for that follow the following steps after cloning the repository:
git fetch
git checkout -b <Your-branch-name>
